üìÑ Overview

This configuration template is designed to harden Cisco switches using industry best practices for VLAN segmentation, Layer 2 security, DHCP snooping, DAI, IP Source Guard, and more. It is intended for environments requiring strict access control, including enterprise networks, data centers, and branch office deployments.

The configuration prioritizes:

Layer 2 and Layer 3 security

Access control

Segmentation

QoS

Monitoring

Operational integrity

üìÅ Structure of the Configuration
Section	Description
Initial Setup	Sets hostname, domain, passwords, SSH, and disables unnecessary services
VLAN Creation	Defines VLANs for different departments, guests, voice, and management
SVI Setup	Configures Layer 3 interfaces (if applicable) for inter-VLAN routing
Access Port Security	Applies port-security, storm control, voice VLANs, and BPDU guard
Trunk Ports	Securely configures trunk links with allowed VLANs and root guard
Spanning Tree Hardening	Uses Rapid-PVST, loop guard, BPDU guard, and root guard
DHCP Snooping	Prevents rogue DHCP servers on untrusted ports
DAI (ARP Inspection)	Validates ARP packets and mitigates ARP spoofing
IP Source Guard	Blocks spoofed IPs on untrusted ports (requires DHCP snooping)
ACLs	Enforces inter-VLAN access restrictions and guest VLAN limitations
QoS Settings	Prioritizes voice traffic and DSCP marking for critical services
Logging & Monitoring	Configures logging, SNMP, and SPAN for traffic monitoring
SSH & Access Security	Enables encrypted remote access, password policies, MOTD banner
Maintenance & Verification	Includes helpful commands for verification and troubleshooting
